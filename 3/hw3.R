# Classification of breast cancer cases

# 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
# 3-32)
# 
# Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
#   
# a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
# b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
# c) perimeter
# d) area
# e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
# f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
# g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
# h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
# i) symmetry 
# j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
# 
# Several of the papers listed above contain detailed descriptions of
# how these features are computed. 
# 
# The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
# largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
# resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
# 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
# 
# All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.
# 
# 8. Missing attribute values: none
# 
# 9. Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
